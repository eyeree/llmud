    "summary": "You stand before the massive wooden door of the vampire castle.",
    "detail": "As you approach the ominous entrance to the vampire castle, an eerie silence fills the air, punctuated only by the distant howling of wolves. The moon casts its pale light on the crumbling stone walls that surround the castle, revealing dark shadows and strange, twisted forms lurking just out of sight. The massive wooden door, intricately carved with grotesque faces and scenes of carnage, looms before you, both inviting and repelling. A heavy sense of dread settles over you, but you muster your courage and reach for the iron door handle, which is strangely cold to the touch. Just beside the door, you notice a vampire slaying kit, containing a wooden stake, garlic, and a vial of holy water. You take it, knowing that the fiendish vampire lord awaits within these dark halls. With a grinding creak, the door opens, revealing the darkness inside the castle."

    "summary": "A narrow, dimly lit secret passage lined with cobwebs, exuding a sense of dread.",
    "detail": "As you venture into the secret passage, the air changes - it becomes colder, and a suffocating darkness envelops you. The narrow tunnel is dimly lit by an eerie, unnerving glow, and cobwebs stretch across the walls like sinister harbingers clinging to every corner. The sound of your footsteps echo off the stone walls, and the passage seems to continue forever, leading deeper into the unknown. In this ominous corridor, it is impossible to shake the feeling that the vampire lord's menacing power is growing nearer with every step you take. As you move cautiously through the shadows, you desperately grasp onto your vampire slaying kit, hoping it will be enough to vanquish the evil that awaits at the end of this dreadful passageway."

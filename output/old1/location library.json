    "summary": "The dusty library packed with ancient tomes.",
    "detail": "As you step into the library, the dusty air makes you cough. The room is dimly lit by a few flickering candles casting flickering shadows on the towering shelves filled with ancient books and scrolls. Cobwebs cover the corners, and a musty smell of decay and old parchment fills your nostrils. A sense of dread hangs over the room as you realize that some of these texts hold powerful secrets, likely only seen by the vampire lord himself. Despite the unsettling atmosphere, you have a feeling that the ancient book you seek is hidden somewhere among the moldy tomes. You cannot shake the idea that the room harbors more mysteries than meets the eye, and that there may be hidden clues only revealed through the musty pages of these long-forgotten books."

    "summary": "A chamber of torment adorned with grim instruments of pain.",
    "detail": "The very air in the Torture Chamber seems to carry the weight of suffering souls. Around you are bloodstained walls, giving off a stench of decay and despair that permeates the suffocating atmosphere. Wretched screams, now but echoes of the past, still seem to resonate within the room as you behold the ghastly devices scattered throughout: a rusted iron maiden stands ominously, its maw twisted into a perverse grin, while sinister racks and wicked wheels loom in the shadows, taunting those who dare to approach. The silence that pervades is almost deafening, punctuated only by the guttural dripping of unseen ichor that pools upon the granite floor. Despite the apparent absence of living beings, a dreadful sense of sentience clings to every cobweb and fetter, demanding release from its eternal torment."

  "detail": "You've entered a long, eerie hallway adorned with sepulchral tapestries depicting fearsome supernatural beings. Cobwebs dance in the fetid drafts that haunt the narrow way, revealing floor rimed with the sooty patina of ages past. Ghastly grayish light filtering through the dust in the air casts an air of dreadful sinister overtones. The distant echo of falling water adds to a sense of natural decay and abandonment.",

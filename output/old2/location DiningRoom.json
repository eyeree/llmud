    "summary": "A dimly lit, decaying dining room filled with the remnants of lavish banquets long past.",
    "detail": "You step into the Dining Room, immediately enveloped by a heavy, oppressive atmosphere. Flickering candlelight casts menacing shadows throughout the room, revealing a scene of decay and forgotten splendor. The long dining table, once a testament to extravagant feasts, is now a graveyard of rotting food and cobweb-covered silver platters. Portraits of long-dead nobles glare down at you from the wall, their features contorted in a nightmare of cracked paint and peeling canvas. A sinister draft whispers through the room, carrying the sickly-sweet stench of decay and a hint of an echoing laugh. To the South, you see the way back to the Entrance Hall, while the entrance to the Kitchen lies to the West, shrouded in darkness."

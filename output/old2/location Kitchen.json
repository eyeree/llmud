    "summary": "An unsettling, decaying kitchen with a pervasive sense of dread.",
    "detail": "As you enter the decrepit kitchen, you're hit by the putrid stench of rancid food and rotting flesh, permeating the air. The rusted tools and utensils lay scattered and abandoned, like treacherous memories of feasts long past. Shadows of rodents dart furiously about, seeking to salvage sustenance from the mounting decay. A ghastly chandelier dangles overhead, with a single flickering candle, barely holding on to its last breath of light. In the far corner of the room, you notice the gleam of a sharp object, a contrast to the dismal surroundings. It appears to be a silver dagger, its aura beckoning you from within the miasma of this forsaken kitchen."

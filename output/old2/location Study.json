    "summary": "A mysterious study with a secret to uncover.",
    "detail": "As you approach this secluded space, an icy chill greeps up your spine, a sign of the oppressive aura that permeates the room. The air is heavy with the scent of old parchment and the dwindling embers of a once-roaring fireplace. Shadows from flickering candles play upon the walls, weaving stories of long-forgotten knowledge. A massive, dust-covered wooden desk occupies the heart of the room, its meticulously-carved surface laden with age-old manuscripts and curious trinkets. The oppressive room seems to breathe in anticipation, watching as you grow closer to uncovering its secrets. To the south, a hidden door is just barely visible, pleading to be unlocked and explored."

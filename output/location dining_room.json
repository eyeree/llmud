    "summary": "A decaying dining room with a festering feast.",
    "detail": "As you step into the dining room, the stench of rotting food and the sickly sweet smell of decay assail your senses. Cobwebs hang from the high, vaulted ceiling, and flickering candles cast eerie shadows across the room. At the center of the chamber stands a grand, yet clearly abandoned, wooden dining table. Piles of molding meats, fruits, and congealed soups sit in tarnished silver serving dishes, as if the last meal held here had been forgotten for centuries. Grime-streaked portraits of sinister nobility, their eyes seeming to follow your every move, line the crumbling walls. In the far corner of the room, half-hidden behind an overturned chair, you glimpse the gleam of a silver key."

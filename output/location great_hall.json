    "summary": "You are in the grand hall, an eerily majestic chamber, dimly lit by flickering torches.",
    "detail": "As you enter the great hall, an unsettling chill runs down your spine. The vast chamber bears remnants of its once regal stature, now tarnished by decay and the passage of time. Flickering torches cast an ominous glow upon the worn stone walls, engulfed in dark shadows that stretch and sway. Strange, life-like statues of long-forgotten figures stand menacingly in each corner of the room, their expressions twisted in anguish or malevolence. Far above, the vaulted ceiling seems to press down upon you, adding to the atmosphere of dread.

In the center of the hall, a grand staircase ascends to a richly ornate balcony, its railing polished with a layer of dust. To the east lies the door to the library, its entrance shrouded in heavy cobwebs. To the west, you catch a glimpse of a vast dining table through an archway, its grandiosity overshadowed by the rotting food it holds. To the north, a grand but sinister-looking double door hints at the darkness within the throne room of the vampire lord.

An eerie specter hovers near the grand staircase, its sad eyes betraying a lost spirit bound to this accursed realm. This must be the ghost butler, a residual warden of this grand yet decaying castle. He watches you with curiosity and perhaps a hint of hope, as if awaiting your intervention in the prevailing gloom."

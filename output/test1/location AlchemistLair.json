  "detail": "The Alchemist's Lair feels heavy in the air as you behold wooden tables covered in glass flasks and beakers coruscating with prismatic chroma, lining impeccably along almost theatrical hued walls of agitation. Spurts of peculiar oozing ingredients spiral inside ossified jars and revolting arcane experiments adorn the oddments-ridden assemblage in the gloomiest alcoves. It seems that ancient, forbidden research persists with pulsating anima vibrantus in never ending intentions.",
